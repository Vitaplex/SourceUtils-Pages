Below are some useful tools for developing custom assets in the Source engine
## ðŸ–¼ [.SMD viewer (calculates a models $bbox)](https://vitaplex.github.io/SourceUtils-Pages/smdviewer.html)
Drag and drop **.smd** files to view them in a **3D viewer**. Automatically calculates and displays the models `$bbox` for use in **.qc** files!
Meshes are also foolhardily editable by hand in the text area, if you're so inclined...
<details>
  <summary><h2>How to use</h2></summary>
    <h3>Basic usage</h3>
    <li>Drag & Drop files from your computer onto the page to view them </li>
    <li>You can select multiple files from your computer and drag them all onto the page to open several meshes at the same time. They will appear as one collective mesh</li>
    <ul><li>Note that uploading alot of complex mesh data will slow down your browser</li></ul>
    <li>Gaze at your model, edit it or copy the value of <code>$bbox</code> (probably the only useful thing here). $bbox will take into account the size of all your meshes, if you uploaded multiple </li>
    <p>When a mesh is uploaded, it wil appear as a green, untextured version of your mesh. The yellow wireframe box around it is the models calculated bounding box. This will be displayed in the top-right section of your screen</p>
    <h3>3D View Controls</h3>
    <li> <strong>Left-click + drag:</strong> Rotate view</li>
    <li> <strong>Right-click + drag:</strong> Pan view</li>
    <li> <strong>Scroll:</strong> Zoom</li>
    <li> <strong>Mouse3 + Pan up/down:</strong> Zoom in/out fast</li>

## ðŸ–¼ [Sprite detail viewer and editor](https://vitaplex.github.io/SourceUtils-Pages/spriteboundaryvisualizer.html)
Visualize position of detail sprites on images for detail props   
Drag and Drop an image onto the left pane (Must be a .png or .jpeg, [VTFEdit](https://nemstools.github.io/pages/VTFLib-Download.html) can be used to export Textures)  
In the the right pane, the `sprite`-fields on each sprite part will be used to overlay a grid showing where the textures will be.
